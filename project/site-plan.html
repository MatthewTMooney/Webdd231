        <h1>The Game Log</h1>
        <p>
            The Game Log is a site built to help you track, review and share what games you have played, personally, or
            with friends.

            <h2>Site Name</h2>

            <p class="example-label">Proposed Name:</p>
            <p><strong>The Game Log – Track, Review and Share your gaming experience</strong></p>

            <p class="example-label">Reason for Selection:</p>
            <p>
                This site is made for the ever growing collection of fans of video games, the highest grossing and
                fastest growing entertainment market. It is meant to be a fun and helpful way to track and share your
                gaming history with others. The name reflects the idea of keeping a personal log that represents your
                tastes and interests, almost like a subtle form of social media without direct interaction or showing
                off—just tracking what you've done.

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The site is built to help visitors find games, track them, log completion, and leave reviews. This
                information can then be shared via links or screenshots, making it easy to post on social media with a
                single click. Users can visually organize their game experiences and keep a historical record of what
                they've played.

            <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
            <p>
                This color palette is inspired by the classic NES controller, using grays, black, and red to create a
                retro gaming look while remaining clean and readable.

                    <p>
                        This font was chosen to match the retro aesthetic of the color scheme and reinforce a nostalgic
                        8-bit feel associated with classic video games from the 1980s.

                    <p><strong>Font:</strong> Roboto</p>
                    <p>
                        Roboto is clean and modern, resembling a smooth evolution of retro game fonts while remaining
                        readable in dense text, such as reviews and descriptions.

                    <p>
                        The mobile view places a bigger emphasis on the pictures, as it is mostly used to generate
                        screenshots to post online. Content is stacked vertically so users can quickly capture and share
                        their game log or stats.

                    <p>
                        The desktop wireframe is larger and more horizontally focused, allowing everything to be seen or
                        scrolled quickly, and giving more space for text and detailed information.
